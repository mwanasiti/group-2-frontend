<h1>ABOUT US</h1> 
        <p>A system/login app for streamlining attendance records thereby ensuring 
           accountability, proper organisation and enhancing security.
           Most often in learning institutions, you will encounter a situation whereby 
           students and staff attendance data is missing or not properly accounted for.
           In addition,log-in time is vague due to mishandling of data. Security is also compromised
           because visitors come in and out without proper scrutiny and accountability.
